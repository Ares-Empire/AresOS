# AresOS shell mod

Minecraft Java 26.2, Java 25, Fabric Loader 0.19.5, Fabric API 0.161.0+26.2.
Based on the official [Fabric example mod, 26.2 branch](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod/tree/26.2).
Loom 1.19.2 requires the included Gradle 9.8.0 wrapper.

From this directory in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build
.\gradlew.bat runClientGameTest
.\gradlew.bat runClient
```

In Git Bash or Linux, use `./gradlew` instead. `build` runs the unit tests and
server game tests; client game tests are a separate task because they open a
Minecraft window. They use a fake app launcher, close the world and client on
completion, and save regression screenshots in `build/review/01-first-app/`.
Nether-home and seed screenshots go in `../reviews/04-nether-home/`.
The client test task has a ten-minute timeout for a stuck game startup.

Click **AresOS** above Singleplayer on the title screen to reopen **AresHub**,
or choose a seed on the create screen if it does not exist. Seed **49** is
prefilled; **49**, **50** and **26** have quick-pick buttons. Seed entry follows
vanilla Minecraft: numbers use that exact seed, text is hashed, and an empty
field chooses a random seed. Changing the seed resets the placeholder toggle:
on for 49, off otherwise. You can then toggle it yourself.

The optional placeholder is a blackstone/gold floor with a lava pool, four
lanterns, an anchor and a glass enclosure. Seed 49 with the placeholder uses
the surveyed floor at **(-64, 56, 32)** and arrival at **(-63.5, 57, 37.5)**.
Other choices score nearby terrain for solid ground, clear air and a lava view,
then verify safety in the fully generated Nether. With the placeholder off,
arrival uses natural ground and provisioning places or removes **no blocks**.
If no safe location is found, the incomplete save is kept for recovery rather
than carved or retried. A placeholder is built only for an explicitly new
creation; later edits always persist.

To try another seed, click **New AresOS world…** beside AresOS and confirm.
The entire current save is renamed to **AresHub-<date-time>** before the create
screen opens. No save is deleted or replaced. Canceling confirmation keeps
AresHub as it was; canceling creation after confirmation keeps the dated save.
Open dated saves through normal **Singleplayer**. A rename failure leaves the
existing save alone and displays an error.

Press **G** for Build mode, fly around and build wherever you choose. Stand on
solid ground with clear feet and head, away from lava or fire, and run
**`/aresos home set`**. It saves your exact position, dimension and facing
without editing blocks, and makes that spot the arrival on every join and
the respawn point. **`/aresos home`** teleports there while keeping your current
mode; **`/aresos home info`** prints the seed, position, dimension and facing.
These commands need no cheats and accept only the singleplayer host in an
enabled AresOS desktop. Ordinary desktops marked with `/aresos desktop on`
can also set a home without constructing a hub. Joining always enters Live.

The save keeps `aresos-home.properties` (provisioning version and seed/site),
`aresos-home.provisioned` (a permanent provisioning claim, marked complete after
saving provisioning), `data/aresos/nether_home.dat` (initial site and optional exact home), and
the existing desktop marker. Keep the whole world directory with backups.
Only a new creation through the AresOS button can build a hub. If an existing
home loses its home data, it opens without rebuilding, changing gamerules or
enabling the desktop marker, and chat explains how to restore a backup. This
also protects older saves without the separate provisioning claim.
Saved mounts stay at their original location and dimension; home arrivals
always dismount the player.
The button refuses an existing
unrecognized or incomplete `AresHub` instead of replacing it. After a failed
creation, restore the save or use **New AresOS world…** to keep it under a dated name.
Normal Singleplayer and Quick Play (`--world AresHub`) also use the saved hub.
See [seed scoring and alternatives](../reviews/04-nether-home/seeds/README.md).
To repeat the offline generator survey, run `.\gradlew.bat searchNetherSeeds`.

`runClient` uses the isolated `run/` game directory. Worlds created through normal
Singleplayer play like normal Minecraft. In singleplayer, run `/aresos desktop on` to mark the world as an
AresOS desktop; cheats are not needed. This does not build a Nether hub or change
that world's gamerules. Notepad appears in the first empty hotbar
slot. Right-click it to launch, including when looking at a door, chest or
villager; the target stays untouched. Holding right-click or switching slots
while holding does not launch repeatedly. Each release and new press launches
again, even between client ticks.

In an AresOS world, press **G** to switch between Build (creative) and Live
(protected survival). The binding is under **AresOS** in Controls.
`/aresos give notepad` works there without cheats. Desktop commands and mode
switching accept only the singleplayer host, including when open to LAN.
In normal worlds, **G** just shows "Not an AresOS world", and `/aresos give`
does not place anything.

`/aresos desktop off` disables Live protection, hub arrival and automatic app
pinning immediately, keeping existing items and the player's current game mode.
The new home's gamerules remain saved world settings. The marker is saved as
`data/aresos/desktop.dat` in this world save and covers all its dimensions.

## App configuration

The first start creates `config/aresos/apps.json` inside the game directory:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "notepad",
    "name": "Notepad",
    "command": ["notepad.exe"],
    "look": "minecraft:writable_book",
    "pinned": true
  }
]
```

Restart the client after edits. Commands are argument lists passed directly to
`ProcessBuilder`, without a shell. Each app needs a unique lowercase id, a name,
a nonempty command, a vanilla item id, and a boolean `pinned`. An empty list
intentionally disables all configured apps. Missing vanilla items fall back to
the book model. Broken JSON or invalid entries produce a byte-for-byte sibling
backup named `apps.json.broken-<unique id>` before defaults replace the file.
An I/O failure is logged and leaves the original file intact.

On Linux the same configuration works with Linux commands; the default
`notepad.exe` must be replaced with an installed executable. The Linux launcher
has no desktop-specific behavior beyond starting a detached process.

Only survival players in marked AresOS worlds receive Live protection. Void
recovery uses their personal bed/anchor spawn, or the world's default spawn if
the personal spawn is missing; it does not consume respawn-anchor charges.
Pinned apps already anywhere in the inventory are left alone. A full hotbar is
left alone, and pinned placement is tried again on the next join or return to
Live mode. Normal worlds never receive pinned apps. Existing app items can still
launch there.

After an app launch, AresOS watches for the first focus loss within 30 seconds.
On return, it closes only the pause screen created by that focus loss. An Esc
menu, a replacement screen, and focus loss without a launch stay untouched.
Each launch owns its focus tracking, so an older launch failing cannot cancel a
newer launch's return.
